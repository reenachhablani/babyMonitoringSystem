# babyMonitoringSystem
It includes three modules so far of humidity detector , sound detector and camera live-streaming.
Humidity Detector module is used to read the atmospheric humidity and temperature using Raspberry Pi and Arduino and we have made the code such that if it exceeds behind a certain threshold value it will send the message to parents.
Sound Detector module is used to detect the sound of the baby and inform if it is loud enough i.e. crying.
The third module is used to live stream the video.
